Robots in a fantasy wasteland fighting for scrap and surival...
<br /><br />
__What is Fantasy Robot Fighter?__<br />
Fantasy Robot Fighter is a blog project for hacking up and designing tabletop role-playing games. I'll also be writing about Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and how the indie game designer can use it to their advantage. #SwordDream
<br /><br />
__Who am I?__<br />
I'm a guy with a degree in art, a background in fulfillment and inventory and a full-time job on a marketing team designing emails and maintaining a website. I also grew up playing tabletop RPGs and enjoy writing.
<br /><br />
All the art featured on this blog is either my own or from [Old Book Illustrations](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/) unless otherwise stated in the blog entry it is featured on.
<br /><br />
I'll be cross-publishing my posts on SEO over at [medium.com](https://medium.com/@fantasyrobotfighter)
