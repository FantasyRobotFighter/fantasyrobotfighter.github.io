__What is Fantasy Robot Fighter?__<br />
Fantasy Robot Fighter is a blog project for hacking up and designing tabletop role-playing games. I'll also be writing about Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and how the indie game designer can use it to their advantage.

__Who am I?__<br />
I'm a guy with a degree in art, a background in fulfillment and inventory and a full-time job on a marketing team designing emails and maintaining a website. I also grew up playing tabletop RPGs and enjoy writing.
