![MS. I Took Out My Pocket-Perspective - Paul Gavarni](https://fantasyrobotfighter.github.io/assets/images/PocketPerspective.png)

A Chaplain, preacher, or missionary who is ordained by a prominent religious institution and anointed to go out into the galaxy and perform the work of the gods. They are service driven, accustomed to strenuous volunteer work, and no stranger to the hunger pangs associated with fasting. They offer comfort and encouragement to others with their knowledge of theology and the promises of redemption.

Ordained characters believe in the will of the gods and quite possibly in an afterlife as well. Therefore, they are not fearful of death the way others are, as they do not necessarily see death as the end of existence, but only as an end to the physical body.
