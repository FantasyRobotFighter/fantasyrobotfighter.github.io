The _Book of Thumbing_ is an enchanted book bound in the skin of opposable thumbs and dyed a heinous bright blue. Any person who stumbles upon this book will find pages upon pages of indiscriminate data on a selection of random people all neatly written in a continuously updating black ink. Through its pages a reader will be privy to a vast amount of information on various people’s past and present activities. The data updates itself with new information every time the book is opened, causing the reader to feel inclined to check it often. The book does not display attribute scores, skills or abilities but rather information on where a person has been, who they are with, how they are feeling, what their political stance is, and various drawings of food they have recently eaten. 

The _Book of Thumbing_ will tend to always appear and lend itself whenever player characters have need of information about particular NPCs. Using its account of various people’s lives a player could discover an NPC’s most recent location or just some basic clues on where someone has been, what they are doing, or even what they might be capable of doing. The GM can use their discretion but some kind of insight (or what the players believe is insight) should be given to make the Book of Thumbing useful.

Opening the book to gain insight on another person will almost always result in the reader feeling like their life is mundane and boring in comparison to the lives collected within the pages. This is because the _Book of Thumbing_ magically writes about the lives of its subjects in the most interesting and glamorous ways possible. Even the most mundane events are glorified with a false sense of accomplishment and success. Every time the player reads the _Book of Thumbing_, they must make a DC 14 Willpower save or feel utterly depressed about their own life for the rest of the day. On a failed roll all future Willpower saves must be rolled down one step in the dice chain for the next 24 hours. If the reader rolls a natural 1 on their save, they must then roll on the _Book of Thumbing_ Fumble Table and suffer an even worse fate.
