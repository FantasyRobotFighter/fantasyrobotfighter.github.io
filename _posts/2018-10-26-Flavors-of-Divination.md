Give your divination wizard an interesting approach to augury by describing their methods for scrying. You could even roll randomly on this d6 table to see how they go about predicting, identifying and detecting the unknown.  

1. **Skatharomancy:** You keep a live beetle in your pocket or in a small cage that you let scurry through the dirt or dust so you can use its track patterns to discern and decipher untold events. If your beetle dies or escapes you’ll need to roll a nature check to capture a new one.  

2. **Favomancy:** The casting of beans holds answers to untold mysteries. Where the kidney falls or the lentil lies can give you all the information you require concerning any enigma.  

3. **Tyromancy:** Not just a delicious snack that stays fresh in the darkest of dungeons but also a natural focus for forecasting future events. The number of holes in the swiss or the way the mold grows about the gouda can reveal more than most people realize.  

4. **Cephalomancy:** Your skulls are bone maps that when traversed by the tips of your fingers tell tales of what was and what could be. You can pry across telling scalps or keep an extra skull hanging from your belt whose flapping jaw bespeaks prophecy when called upon.  

5. **Oculomancy:** You look long and hard into a person’s eyes to see truth. Reflections of their past sights flicker before you like too many infomercials providing you with details they themselves have missed from previous encounters or events that have not yet occurred in their future.  

6. **Numismatomancy:** Life is black and white, good or evil, lawful or chaotic and all you require to determine which is which is a flip of a coin.
