There are baseboards and then there are the high places. Be it the cobwebbed corners where wall and ceiling meet on the edge of color or the perilous rooftops of an opulant château. All that can reach that outlying trim is the perfect cut-in from a fearless soul who's willing to brave unmeasured heights while teetering on a mass of poorly stacked movables. That soul is you. Employed by common house painters for your impeccable balance and your steady hand that cuts sharper with a brush than any warrior could cut with their blade. For there is no place too high nor ceiling too vaulted for the grace of your physique.
